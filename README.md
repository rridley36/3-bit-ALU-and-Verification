3-bit ALU and Verification

This project implements and verifies a 3-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in SystemVerilog. 
The ALU performs basic arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, AND, OR, XOR, and modulo. 
A Verilog testbench is also provided to verify the correctness of the ALU using an automated test suite.

Features

	•	3-bit Input Width: The ALU operates on 3-bit inputs for both operands.
	•	Addition (+)
	•	Subtraction (-)
	•	Multiplication (*)
	•	Division (/) with handling for divide-by-zero cases
	•	Logical AND (&)
	•	Logical OR (|)
	•	Logical XOR (^)
	•	Modulo (%) with handling for modulo-by-zero cases
